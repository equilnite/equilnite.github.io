                    <p>A meaningful place that I have chosen is the Walt Disney Concert Hall. This concert hall is a very memorable part of my highschool experience in my school's choir because of the large gathering that we would attend annually to have a large <a href='https://lamasterchorale.org/high-school-choir-festival'>choral concert</a>. </p>
                    <p>
                        It is a very iconic building in Los Angeles and is one of the most famous concert halls in the world. It also serves as the home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The concert hall was designed by Frank Gehry and opened on October 24, 2003. The project of constructing the Walt Disney Concert Hall started in 1987, when Lillian Disney donated $50 million for it. However, in 1994, the project was brought to a stop, mainly due to funding problems. A cost overrun was announced, due to stricter earthquake codes. The project was able to continue in 1996, after more fundraising.

                    <p>In 1992, Esa-Pekka Salonen conducted his first concert as the new music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Due to hardships, Gehry threatened to quit a few years later, but agreed to stay on after an intervention by Diane Disney Miller. As construction continues, a theater space was able to be built from a gift by Walt Disney Co. A change of managers for the LA Philharmonic happened in 1998, with Ernest Fleishmann stepping down and being succeeded by Willem Wijnbergen. Also in 1998, changes in design were made, including using stainless steel instead of limestone for the hall exterior. However, the glare of the stainless steel had heated up the rooms of nearby tenants. The surface was then dulled and had reduced glare. The Los Angeles Master Chorale starts to make its home at the Disney Hall in 2003. </p>

                    <p>In addition, the hall isn't just about showcasing and sharing classical music. Surprisingly, a rock concert that showcases electronic music was performed on March 2006. Whatâ€™s also interesting is that the hall has been used as a platform for politics; Krystian Zimmerman had stopped his performance at the Disney Hall to make a political statement, as he was protesting U.S. military policies.</p>
