project, we are interested in data about married women and their background and type of contraceptive. We explore the data, finding distributions of some of the attributes in the dataset and compare attributes with other attributes using distribution plots, count plots, and heat maps to try and point out relationships between variables and attempt to select features. After that, we construct models through logistic regression and decision tree methods fitted on the data to attempt to accurately predict the contraceptive use of women based on their background information and also select each feature individually to see how effective each one is to predicting contraceptive use. We conclude that our decision tree model is slightly more effective at predicting the contraceptive method, but overall our models are both better than a naive model which predicts no contraceptive method for all observations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.y9zvm73vdw3a"><span class="c5">Introduction</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This project aims to construct a model that can be used to classify contraceptive use based on select features. We are interested in the factors that are effective in predicting the type of contraceptive use based on data from a contraceptive data set that was conducted on a set of married women (who were not pregnant at the time) and contains information about their background (e.g. age, number of children, education) and the type of contraceptive they use. To determine features to use and possible new features to add to our models, we create visualizations of the data, distribution plots for numerical data, bar plot for categorical data and ultimately condition this data on the contraceptive method to observe relationships. Heatmaps are also made to identify relationships throughout the data as a whole since there are categorical variables in the data. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c2 c7" id="h.2mu7z9cj1pdw"><span class="c5"></span></h2><h2 class="c2" id="h.cbh4dthv7a7c"><span class="c5">Description of Data</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The primary description of the data can be found at:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c12"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Contraceptive%2BMethod%2BChoice&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1590403258894000">https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Contraceptive+Method+Choice</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The figures will commonly refer to the values as referenced to in the primary description</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In this project we use the contraceptive dataset consisting of 10 attributes: 2 numerical variables, 4 categorical variables, 3 binary variables, and a class attribute. We then transformed this data by one-hot encoding the categorical variables and binary variables to be used for feature engineering. There were no missing values so no further data cleaning was needed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When doing exploratory data analysis, we found some interesting data interactions and distributions. In the following distribution plots found on Page 3, we visualized the distributions of the numerical variables conditioned on the contraceptive method. In Figure 1a, the number of children was conditioned on the contraceptive method and we found there to be little any significance difference in the number of children birthed between contraceptive methods. We can however see that that method 1 appears to result in a more significant right tail and more distribution to the larger values than the other two plots, which seems to indicate that no contraceptive used tends to mean more children. These characteristics in the method 1 plot also transfers to method 2, but the right tail and distribution shifts are significantly lesser. The third method, long-term contraceptive has the least significant right tail and a tighter spread, indicating that taking long term methods tends to indicate a lesser number of children. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">On the other hand, when we plot the distributions of wife age in Figure 1b, we see indication that there is significant difference in how wife ages are distributed given a contraceptive method. The first method (no use), there is indication of a slight bimodal distribution in age, with peaks around 25 and 45; overall this method shows slight uniform distribution. As we switch over to longer usages of contraceptive, we see distributions of wife age become unimodal. In the second method (short term use) there is a center of around 35 and the third method has a center around 25~30.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">On further investigation and attempt to engineer a new feature for use, we explore the possibility of using number of children divided by wife age as a new feature in Figure 1c, however, it seems that this is not that effective of a feature compared to if we were to just use the two features that it was formed from. We notice that we lose a lot of the information of the wife age distributions and these new distributions seem to conform more to the number of children distributions, so this indicates that it&#39;s probably a good idea to just stick with the former two features.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 224.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 224.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 224.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 224.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 224.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 224.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the following barplot (Figure 2), we saw that there were sample groups that were extremely small in size, which might indicate a risk in overfitting in a decision tree since the tree might go into great depth to classify these small groups, thus, we should be wary of this issue and prevent overfitting for decision tree and related methods of modeling. We also see that the trend in proportion/count increase is different between religions. For an Islamic woman (level 0), the usage of the contraceptives steadily rises across education levels and surpasses the no contraceptive method group easily. Meanwhile for non-islamic women (level 1), the proportions between methods stay pretty slightly constant until the 4th level of &nbsp;a wife&rsquo;s education, where we see a dramatic change in the proportions; short-term usage matches up with long-term usage and they both exceed the proportion of non-contraceptive users.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 273.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 273.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In our last visualization (Figure 3, Page 5), we created a heatmap with no row clustering and only column clustering. The purpose of this was to observe possible relationships between variables and also to see if we could see relationships in the data that would seem to indicate a contraceptive method, this is also the reason for interpreting the categorical variables as numerical ones. One remarkable thing that we can see from this map is the banding with the contraceptive methods. Husband education, wife education, standard of living all seem to show that higher levels/higher values of these variables tend to mean that short-term usage contraceptives were used and there seems to be good media exposure and slightly more middle-age women in this group. Other than this observation, we see that the other variables seem to take on random values and won&#39;t give much information in what type of contraceptive method is used. Over all from these heatmaps, the randomness of most of these observations indicates to some small degree that there is little correlation between variables; there is only a scarce pattern that we can observe among observations with similar traits. As for associations between variables, husband and wife education levels seem to show a slight one-to-one relationship. This also shows some other relationships that weren&#39;t evident through the clustered columns. We see that the standard of living is closely related to the education levels of the wife and husband and the wife&#39;s religion and work status are further related to those. Although we do see clustering in the 4 variables left, there does not seem to be much conclusions we can make at a glance since things seem to be more evenly spread out with no apparent relationships. </span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 604.00px; height: 747.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 604.00px; height: 747.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.qyjpr42uv2n6"><span class="c5">Description of Methods</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We used the logistic regression model and the decision tree model to predict contraceptive method use.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We split the data into a training set containing 80% of the original data and the testing set containing the rest of the data. The categorical variables in these data sets were one hot encoded such that each level of the variables were separate columns in the data set. Then we make the logistic regression model with 4000 iterations using the lbfgs solver and fit it into the training set. It is then used to predict the test contraceptive use data using the 9 other variables. This is then repeated for the decision tree model. Then each variable is individually used to fit the models, keeping the same training and test set.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.l59nrqlbnfv9"><span class="c5">Summary of Results</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The logistic regression model achieves a 54.24% test accuracy while the decision tree model achieves a 56.95% test accuracy with all the features fit to the models. These model accuracies are better than a naive model that just indiscriminately selects the highest count contraceptive method, no contraceptive, that would achieve a 43.73% accuracy with the same test set. Additionally, each feature was individually isolated and fit to both models and found that the number of children variable using the decision tree model had the highest test accuracy out of any single feature and model combination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.q2zj47uuhkpl"><span>Discussion</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Firstly, the data presented to us has some issues. The data itself is a snapshot of women at a single time, so it doesn&rsquo;t contain any relevant information about the past of an observation. This means that we have no idea if the woman had recently switched to a new contraceptive method (they could&rsquo;ve just switched and this the data they gave us would lead us to predicting their previous method). In the way that the data is presented, this is an uncertainty that can throw off our model(s). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We found the number of children feature very interesting. Although it had the highest test accuracy for the decision tree model, it also had the lowest for the logistic regression model. It also had the biggest difference in accuracy for the two models. Another interesting feature is that the age of the wife, the only other numerical variable, had the lowest test accuracy for the decision tree model. A feature we thought to be useful would be the age of the wife, since people who want kids usually have a certain age they want to be parents, and contraceptive use would help with that. The test accuracy, however, was pretty average in predicting contraceptive use compared to the other variables. We had a challenge with interpreting our results of the data we got for the single variable test accuracies. It seemed odd that five of the variables perfectly match each other in the test accuracies with respect to their models. The limitations of the analysis that we did are that we only either fitted the model on all the variables or only one of them. We did not try two, three, etc. variables at a time and assumed that it would not make much of a difference. Ethical dilemmas we face with this data are that we may influence our thoughts on predicting contraceptive use poorly based on this. The accuracy obtained from the models are not that good, and we may incorrectly predict the contraceptive use very easily. Having more instances to the data could strengthen our analysis since the test accuracy data do not seem to have enough variance. An ethical concern we might encounter in studying this problem is that we may wrongly assume something about others without knowing them much. For example we might assume that if they have a high amount of children that they do not use contraception. This can be addressed by having an understanding that this problem is complex and should be tackled on with caution. In addition, if accurate enough, a model based on data of this kind may also lead to corporations interested in marketing to women to spy on data collected on an individual and target them to make profits.</span></p><div><p class="c6"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10"></span></p></div></body></html>
