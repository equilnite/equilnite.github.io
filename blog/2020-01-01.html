        <p> 2019 was a pretty rough year for me even though I had been taking only 13 units the past two semesters.
          I first had to face the pressure of getting at least an A- in my linear algebra class and then a B- in my probability class,
          but everything went fine! I'm alive and well!
          I'd say... at Berkeley, the worst and best things about classes here are that classes are curved.
          Even if you work your ass off and try to do better then other people to get that A,
          your grade is just dependent on how much more smart you are compared to other people in your class,
          but on the other side of the coin, at least you're pretty much guaranteed a passing grade in the classes you want to pass by a small margin
          since there will always be people who have absolutely no idea what is going on in the class.
          </p>
          <p> So three things that I've learned from our mandated grade curving is that: </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Don't be hurt if you get a lower grade then you wanted; it's inevitable and remember that you just did a little worse but know almost everything
              the other people know </li>
            <li> Don't wallow in fear before a quiz, exam, or whatever; you'll do fine in the class even if your GPA will take a small dip! </li>
            <li> Your GPA won't effect you that much; just impress companies with your knowledge and refresh on concepts that you've been shaky on! </li>
          </ul>
        <p> And so now, because I've gotten the grades that I needed for declaring statistics, I'm going to start my declaration process as soon as the petition
          period starts! I'm also going to work towards a data science degree now too. Honestly, everyone should take a computer science class in college, for me it was
          really fun to take and helped me discover a new interest in life. It was like learning a new language and gives you new perspective on the way computer programs
          function as well as a new perspective on approaching problems. I've added all my projects to this website, and the one thing that I find most interesting
          about the fields that I'm studying is model fitting. Being able to predict the probability of something occuring, classifying something based on other data, or predicting
          a value based on a large number of variables was something that I never thought about before taking my classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the new year, I'm going to strive to stop wasting so much time procrastinating on non school things and work towards getting A's in all my courses. Also!!!
          I've found a gym buddy and will be trying my best to wake up early and go to the gym regularly instead of being a potato as I have for the past 19 years.
          In addition I'm going to try and start getting some real-life experience in my studies; try to get some research, maybe some professional clubs. But, overall,
          I'm going to try to continue to keep my mental health up; rest when I need to rest and don't overwork myself when studying. So... that's pretty much what I'm
          trying for this year! Oops I forgot, I'm also going to try to keep up with my life on this website! On a side note, I'm also going to create full blog functionality
          with a login, SQL, and php to simplify the process because making a html file for each post is maybe just a bit (very) inefficient.
        </p>
